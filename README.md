# Philosophers
42 project to learn the basics of threads.

Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger.
A variation on the [philosophers dining problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem).
